# predictLNCrna
## A deep learning model for the prediction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model with k-mer as the only feature for the classification lncRNAs and mRNAs by using only RNA sequences. We tested the model on human datasets, and compared it with PLEK, CPC, PlncRNA-HDeep and CICN. The results showed that the accuracy of our model is up to 98.2% , which indicate that our model is better than all the methods above.
Also this study proposes five other Machine Learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes (NB),AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), support vector machine and Random Forest(RF) Classifiers to predict lncRNAs from RNA-seq data, the accuracy of all the models are compared with our deep learning model and finally recommended the best model for the classification.
